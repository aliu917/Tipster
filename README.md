Tipster is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Angela Liu

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Ability to add a custom tip (not completed)

## Notes

In my customTipViewController, I was changing the value of the tip, but it was hard for me to properly take the changed value and use it in my main viewController.
